# Heading Sensor
Using UBlox RTK technology, it is possible to create a Moving Base/Rover arrangement where the Rover GNSS sensor holds the heading and distance from the Moving base. However, this information is available in a UBX sentence only. 
This code will translate from UBX to a standard NMEA sentence. It is intended for a Pi Zero or similar controller.
